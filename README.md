# JS Strange Things CRUD app

### Description

- Create a "CraigsList-like" App using the Stranger's Things API
- It can be seen at https://https://strange-things.netlify.app/

### What I Learned:

- How to use the full range of Create, Read , Update, Delete functions.
- How to work with get, post, put, patch and delete functions.
- How to work with JWT Webtokens to authenticate user login/logout.
- How use multiple modals for various functions.
- How to work from a suggested development path / road map.
- How to complete a project from a list of user stories.

### What I am Proud Of:

- As an added feature I was able to make the side by have an variable width and store it in local storage.
- Like the Slack app, when you log back in your user preference will load up at log in.

### How I Would Uplevel It:

- I would rewrite of lot of this code to make it more DRY and economical.
- There is a lot of WET code related to how various modals are served.
